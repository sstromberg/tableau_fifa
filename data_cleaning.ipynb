    "# Preparing for a sample Tableau dash\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Tableau-provided FIFA18.csv dataset -- containing player demographics and attribute ratings for 17k+ players in the 2018 version of the game -- to make some reasonably-interesting visualizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Aging \"curves\" by position -- selecting the top X% of players in each age-position cohort and plotting them as a scatter, with color by position. Unfortunately, this dataset uses integer-age instead of DOB (so will collapse players from 32 and 0 days to 32 and 364 days into one category). We should be able to see growth/peak/decline, and how attackers peak younger than defenders peak younger than keepers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) \"Value\" by age and position -- could do 95th percentile or something to reduce impact of outliers, then plot as line chart. Want to see if defenders are relatively under-valued (at least in the close-to-real economics of the video game simulation).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Overall rating by wages -- not sure if game gets real wage data or guesstimates. Everyone likes to laugh at overpaid professional athletes; underpaid ones are more likely to move (or at least renegotiate). We have nationality and club team, but not the nation/league the club plays in, so it'll be extra work to compare leagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by exploring the data to find out which of these features are already present and which we'll have to engineer."
